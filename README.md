## Springe

Springe is Web Application (soon to be Native Application) that helps you find your series to watch (binge).
Most people "binge" series nowadays, and the frustration that comes with this way of watching tv-series is that
most people struggle to find a good tv show after they are done watching a series. 
So, the idea is: 
    
> "What if you could ask a system what you are currently watching and it gave you suggestion(s) on what show to watch after?
Regardless of your current streaming service"


## Built with
* Materialize - Minimalistic CSS framework based on Google's Material Design.
* JQuery - Javascript library for interactivity on websites
