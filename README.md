__1. What is "Springe"?__

Springe is Web Application (soon to be Native Application) that helps you find your next series to binge. 
Most people binge series nowadays, and the frustration that comes with this way of watching tv-series is that
most people struggle to find a good tv show after they are done watching a series. 
So, the idea is: 
    
   _"What if you could ask a system what you are currently, watching and it gave you suggestion(s) on what show to watch after?"_

  The is answer is **Springe** _Your next binge thing!_
     
          
  
  __2. The Code__
   
  Springe is a HTML/CSS Web Application, using Javascript and Jquery, pulling JSON data from an open TV-Show API provided by TV-Maze.
  The Web Application is basically a personal project experimenting with the Materialize; a minimalistic CSS framework.
